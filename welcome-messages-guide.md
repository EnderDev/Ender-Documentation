# 🙋 Welcome Messages - Guide

## 👌 Easy, sick welcome message

All you need to get started is type...

```
!settings joinmsg
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Your prefix might be different for the bot, to check the prefix; just check out that nickname Ender has.
{% endhint %}

## 🍖 Spooky Scary Skeletons

So, you can use many variables in your message. So say if your message was...

```text
Welcome {{user}} to {{server}}
```

It would translate to...

```text
Welcome Ender to Epic Server
```

#### _Pretty cool right?_

## 📰 Variable Cheatsheet

I'm just like the kid who deals out the answers in the math exam, _**but better.**_

```text
{{user}} => Ender
{{discriminator}} => 0000 (the four digits after your name)
{{server}} => Epic Server
{{joined}} => Sat, 1 January 2019 23:59:59 GMT
{{id}} => 000000000000 (the discord id associated with your account)
{{membercount}} => 50
```

Pretty easy right, also you can see all these in...

```text
!settings joinmsg
```
